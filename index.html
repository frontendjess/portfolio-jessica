					<div class="about-text">
						<p>
							I fell in love with computers and programming from the age of 12,
							when I learned how to program a little turtle to make shapes, kind
							of creating geometrical artwork through the keyboard - who else
							remembers this turtle? This was probably the first time I felt
							what empowerement was.
						</p>
						<p>
							From the little turtle, I moved onto webdesign, and fast-forward
							to present day, I am a front-end developer with a passion for
							creativity with an entreupreunal/marketing mindset - this is when
							you go to school for business but end up as a developer, hehe. -
							No worries, I am currently attending NOROFF, which soon in a year
							I will officially have my front end development degree.
						</p>
						<p>
							Having an international background, attending US military school,
							then furthering my education at ECU in Australia for business.
							Life in my 20s lead me down a different path, which I enjoyed my
							young career. Moving to Norway, has in a way re-set my lifes path
							into where I have always wanted to be - webdesign & development.
						</p>
						<p>
							On my free time, you can catch me, well, trying to keep up with my
							toddler, working on a couple side projects, and basking in any
							sunlight the Norwegian weather will allow us.
